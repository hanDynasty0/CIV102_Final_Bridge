# CIV102 Bridge Project

This repository contains MATLAB code (in both the mlx and more easily-accessible txt file) I wrote in order to help my team simulate bridge properties and optimize bridge design for our CIV102 Bridge Project and Competition. The txt file was added more recently to allow easier viewing access to the MATLAB code used.
The project entailed making a bridge out of matboard and cement glue in order to sustain the weight of a model train pushed across the bridge.
