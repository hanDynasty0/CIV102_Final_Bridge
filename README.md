# CIV102 Bridge Project

This repository contains MATLAB code I wrote in order to help my team simulate bridge properties and optimize bridge design for our CIV102 Bridge Project and Competition.
The project entailed making a bridge out of matboard and cement glue in order to sustain the weight of a model train pushed across the bridge.
